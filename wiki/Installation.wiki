 # Connect your favorite SVN client to http://cf-flex-user-auth.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ then *export* the trunk as a new project in your workspace. Doing an export will get all the files without any of the links back to the SVN repository.
 # Set up a virtual host using apache to point to /cf-flex-user-auth/wwwroot
{{{
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "D:\webroot\cf-flex-user-auth\wwwroot"
    ServerName cf-flex-user-auth.local
</VirtualHost>
}}}
 # Restart Apache
 # Edit your etc/hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc or /etc/hosts). Add the following line:
{{{
127.0.0.1	cf-flex-user-auth.local
}}}

 # Create a new ColdFusion datasource. This example assumes the datasource name _cf-flex-user-auth_. 

*Note:* If you change the name of the datasource, you must search for and change the following line in Application.cfc:

{{{

}}}
